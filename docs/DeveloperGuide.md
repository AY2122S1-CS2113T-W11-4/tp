## üìî Design & Implementation

This section brings developers through the general flow of the programme, the various components involved, and the overall design of their
implementation.

## Design

### Main Components

This section describes the overall design architecture of _Foodorama_.

The `Main` class is responsible for initializing the main components upon start-up of the application, and
deciding the execution path of the application through the main components based on reading the user inputs.

The application consists of the following main components responsible for the high-level execution of a user input:
1. `Foodorama`: Initializes all the other components and coordinates them.
2. `Ui`: Handles the displaying of all command results and error messages to the user.
3. `Storage`: Handles the creation, reading from and writing from the `/data` directory 
4. `InputParser`: Makes sense from the user input and decides which `Command` class to call.
5. `DishList`: Handles the collection of Dish objects used by Foodorama
6. `IngredientList`: Handles the collection of Ingredient objects used by Foodorama.
7. `Command`: Collection of classes that handle the different user commands

The architecture diagram below shows a high-level overview of the structure between different components.

![](images/architecture_diagram.png)

### General Flow

Describes the step-by-step sequence from User Input to the Output.

![](images/main_sequence.png)

* User is greeted by welcome screen.
* User begins typing inputs.
* Inputs get parsed by InputParser returning the appropriate Command.
* Command gets executed and respective output gets displayed.
* Once user is done using the application, he can send an exit message prompting a goodbye message.
* Application exits.

### Input Parsing

The `InputParser` class is responsible for deconstructing User Inputs to identify Commands and Parameters for execution.

![](images/input_parser_sequence.png)

* Gets command name of user input by checking if the users input starts with any of the strings that are defined for commands (add dish, list dish, help etc.).
* Throws an exception if no matching command is found.
* Takes rest of user input as parameterString.
* Based on command name splits the parameterString into respective parameters to respective command classes for execution.

### Storage

The `Storage` class is responsible for the reading and writing of *Food-O-Rama* data. Data is stored as .txt files under *'Data'* folder.

* After every operation writes the names of the Ingredient, weight of Ingredient Stored and weight of Ingredient Wasted, into a text file called `ingredients.txt`.
* After every operation writes the names of the Dish, weight of Dish Waste and constituents of the Dish if there are any, into a text file called `dishes.txt`.

#### Loading Data
![](images/storage_load_sequence.png)

* At the start of the program, Duke calls `Storage.load()`
  * This method in the `Storage` class is responsible for invoking `loadIngredients()`, `loadDishes()` and `loadFormat()`
* After accessing `ingredients.txt`, `ingredientList.add()` is called for every ingredient that exists in the list and is added to the active
ArrayList, `IngredientList.ingredientList`
* Then, after accessing `dishes.txt`, `dishList.add()` is called for every dish that exists in the list and is added to the active
  ArrayList, `DishList.dishList`
* Any inputs in the data file that are invalid get disregarded and only valid inputs get loaded. 
  As a result the invalid inputs get sanitized once Foodorama is started 
* Finally, the method also sets up the `formats.txt` file that contains all the relevant formats in which the data is saved along with examples
  * This is present in the load method as opposed to the write method as it only needs to be called once per run of *Food-O-Rama*
  
‚ùï *Note: `dishes.txt`,`ingredients.txt` and `formats.txt` can be found in the `data` folder from the root directory.*

#### Saving Data
![](images/storage_write_sequence.png)

* After every command, Duke calls `Storage.write(Ingredient)`, then `Storage.write(Dish)`.
  * This method in the `Storage` class is responsible for writing to the respective text file depending on the mode.
* `Storage.write()` will access the respective text file and save to its respective save format.


* ‚ùï **Save Formats:**
  * Dishes
    * `DISH_NAME | DISH_WASTAGE | DISH_WASTAGE / NUM_OF_LINKED_INGREDIENTS | LIMIT | INGREDIENTS_LINKED`
    * ‚ùï Limit is -1 if limit has not been defined.
    * ‚ùï DISH_WASTAGE / NUM_OF_LINKED_INGREDIENTS is DISH_WASTAGE if no ingredients have been linked.
  * Ingredients
    * `INGREDIENT_NAME | INGREDIENT_STORAGE | INGREDIENT_WASTAGE | LIMIT | EXPIRY`
    * ‚ùï Limit is -1 if limit has not been defined.
    * ‚ùï Expiry is null if expiry has not been defined.

### Data Structures

The `Dish`, `DishList`, `Ingredient` and `IngredientList` classes are responsible for the handling and 
manipulation of the *Food-O-Rama* data.

![](images/dish_ingredient.png)

* The `Dish` class contains the Dish's Name, its wastage and its constituents.
* The `Ingredient` class contains the Ingredient's Name, the weight of Ingredient in storage, the weight of Ingredient
wasted as well as the weight of Ingredient wasted from Dish wastage.
* The `DishList` class comprises an array of `Dish` along with functions to find, retrieve and modify dishes.
* The `IngredientList` class comprises an array of `Ingredient` along with functions to find, retrieve and modify ingredients.
  * The Sort function arranges Dishes / Ingredients in descending order of their wastage.
  * The Graph function visualises the wastage of Dishes / Ingredients for easier analysis.

### User-Interface Component

![](images/UiClass.png)

The `Ui` Class is responsible for the printing of interactive messages whenever a user types an input. It handles print messages to the Command Line Interface from when the program loads, to after every input by the user and finally when the user exits the program.

The interface of the program utilizes the ClearScreen class to clear the terminal after every user input through the built-in `ProcessBuilder` Java class. Such a feature allows greater readability and focus for the user as the terminal will not be cluttered with past commands.
`Ui` will call `ClearScreen.clearConsole()` method to clear the terminal.

The ProcessBuilder class will send a respective command to the terminal depending on the Operating System of the user.
The command it sends to the terminal is as follows:
* `cls` for Windows CMD Terminals.
* `clear` for Linux/MacOS Terminals.

`ClearConsole()` Code Snippet:

```
 public static void clearConsole() {
        try {
            // Get current operating system
            String getOS = System.getProperty("os.name");

            if (getOS.contains("Windows")) {
                // Try clear for Windows
                // "/c" - execute string as command, "cls" -  Clear terminal
                ProcessBuilder pb = new ProcessBuilder("cmd", "/c", "cls");
                Process startProcess = pb.inheritIO().start();
                startProcess.waitFor();
            } else {
                // Try clear for MacOS/Linux
                // "clear" - Clear terminal
                ProcessBuilder pb = new ProcessBuilder("clear");
                Process startProcess = pb.inheritIO().start();
                startProcess.waitFor();
            }
        } catch (Exception e) {
            System.out.println(e);
        }
    }
```

### Exceptions

The `FoodoramaException` class is responsible for handling errors such as unrecognised user commands and 
improper parameters. It does so by calling the `Ui` class to print error messages that prompt the User to 
type in correct Commands/Parameters.

### Command Abstraction

![](images/command.png)

* Different Command Classes that perform different tasks by calling various functions of the Object Classes.  
* All inherit from an abstract `Command` class with one execute method that takes an Arraylist<String> as input.

## Implementation

### Find

### Edit
The implementation of the Edit function allows the User to edit several 
instance variables of the Dishes and Ingredients present in the DishList and
IngredientList.

![](images/edit_dish_name_sequence_diagram.png)
This Sequence Diagram shows how the `EditDishNameCommand` class functions.

Currently the User is able to edit the following:
* Dish Name
* Dish Wastage Weight
* Ingr Name
* Ingr Wastage Weight
* Ingr Storage Weight

The remaining Edit classes, namely `EditDishWasteCommand`, `EditIngrNameCommand`, 
`EditIngrStoredCommand` and `EditIngrWasteCommand` follow sequences similar to 
the one shown above in their implementation.

### Set

### Graph

![](images/graph_class_dig.png)

Graph works by creating a 2d grid and printing the bars based on the current position of the terminal cursor. 
This lets us bypass the restriction in a CLI based application where you can only print from up to down and 
the bars can get printed "vertically". This is done by calculating the lengths of the bars beforehand and 
using these lengths along with the current coordinates to print either an empty space or a bar. 

Despite this due to CLI and ascii limitations, printing of fractional values posed an issue. This was because you are unable
to print half a character and using special unicode characters would break cross-platform functionality. The solution 
that we implemented was to have a digit in the top most bar if we have fractional heights. This way while we still don't get 
a perfect representation, we are capable of giving the value accurate to one decimal place. So if the height was 3.33 units
it would be represented by 3 filled bars and the 4th bar will have a 3 within indicating its value is between 3.3 to 3.4 
as shown in the figure below

### Terminal refreshing
The interface of the program utilizes the ClearScreen class to clear the terminal after every user input through the built-in `ProcessBuilder` Java class. Such a feature allows greater readability and focus for the user as the terminal will not be cluttered with past commands.
`Ui` will call `ClearScreen.clearConsole()` method to clear the terminal.

The ProcessBuilder class will send a respective command to the terminal depending on the Operating System of the user.
The command it sends to the terminal is as follows:
* `cls` for Windows CMD Terminals.
* `clear` for Linux/MacOS Terminals.

`ClearConsole()` Code Snippet:

```
 public static void clearConsole() {
        try {
            // Get current operating system
            String getOS = System.getProperty("os.name");

            if (getOS.contains("Windows")) {
                // Try clear for Windows
                // "/c" - execute string as command, "cls" -  Clear terminal
                ProcessBuilder pb = new ProcessBuilder("cmd", "/c", "cls");
                Process startProcess = pb.inheritIO().start();
                startProcess.waitFor();
            } else {
                // Try clear for MacOS/Linux
                // "clear" - Clear terminal
                ProcessBuilder pb = new ProcessBuilder("clear");
                Process startProcess = pb.inheritIO().start();
                startProcess.waitFor();
            }
        } catch (Exception e) {
            System.out.println(e);
        }
    }
```


## üìÇ Product Scope

Provides Developers with insights into our intended customers and the background to the problem to which
*Food-O-Rama* finds a solution.

### Target User Profile

Restaurant owners who will delegate their Inventory Management to Managers who are fast typists with experience in using
the Command Line Interface.

### Value Proposition

By presenting the wastage statistics, we can help restaurant owners figure out which dishes are contributing the most to
wastage at the restaurant. This way, they can allocate their resources more efficiently to better doing dishes. Thus, we 
are reducing time wastage due to cooking of excess dishes and also saving money from purchasing unnecessary ingredients. 
Therefore, there‚Äôs a two-fold saving. Additionally, we are also contributing to reducing Singapore's contribution to 
global food wastage.
