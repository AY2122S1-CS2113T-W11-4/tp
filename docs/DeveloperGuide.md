# Food-O-Rama Developer Guide ‚úç

## üåë Introduction
*Food-O-Rama* is a Java based Command-Line-Interface (CLI) application.

This Developer Guide serves to inform developers on the design and implementation of
*Food-O-Rama* to assist them in the development process of APIs. It also helps them 
realise the target user profile that motivated us to build this application.

##‚≠ê Setting Up & Getting Started
1. Fork *Food-O-Rama*'s repository from [here](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2113T-W11-4/tp).
2. Clone the repository into your computer.
3. Import the project into your IDE.
4. For optimal results, it is recommended to use JDK 11.

## üìî Design & Implementation

This section brings developers through the general flow of the programme, the various components involved, and the overall design of their
implementation.

### General Flow

Describes the step-by-step sequence from User Input to the Output.

![](images/main_sequence.png)

* User is greeted by welcome screen
* User begins typing inputs
* Inputs get parsed by InputParser returning the appropriate Command
* Command gets executed and respective output gets displayed
* Once user is done using the application, he can send an exit message prompting a goodbye message
* Application exits

### Input Parsing

The `InputParser` class is responsible for deconstructing User Inputs to identify Commands and Parameters for execution.

* Gets command name of user input by checking if the users input starts with any of the strings that are defined for commands (add dish, list dish, help etc.)
* Throws an exception if no matching command is found
* Takes rest of user input as parameterString
* Based on command name splits the parameterString into respective parameters to respective command classes for execution

### Storage

The `Storage` class is responsible for the reading and writing of *Food-O-Rama* data. Data is stored as .txt files under *'Data'* folder.

* After every operation writes the names of the Ingredient, weight of Ingredient Stored and weight of Ingredient Wasted, into a text file called ingredients.txt
* After every operation writes the names of the Dish, weight of Dish Waste and constituents of the Dish if there are any, into a text file called dishes.txt


### Data Structures

The `Dish`, `DishList`, `Ingredient` and `IngredientList` classes are responsible for the handling and 
manipulation of the *Food-O-Rama* data.

![](images/dish_ingredient.png)

* The `Dish` class contains the Dish's Name, its wastage and its constituents.
* The `Ingredient` class contains the Ingredient's Name, the weight of Ingredient in storage, the weight of Ingredient
wasted as well as the weight of Ingredient wasted from Dish wastage
* The `DishList` class comprises an array of `Dish` along with Sort and Graph functions.
* The `IngredientList` class comprises an array of `Ingredient` along with Sort and Graph functions.
  * The Sort function arranges Dishes / Ingredients in descending order of their wastage
  * The Graph function visualises the wastage of Dishes / Ingredients for easier analysis 

### User-Interface Component

![](images/UiClass.png)

The `Ui` Class is responsible for the printing of interactive messages whenever a user types an input. It handles print messages to the Command Line Interface from when the program loads, to after every input by the user and finally when the user exits the program.

The interface of the program utilizes the ClearScreen class to clear the terminal after every user input through the built-in `ProcessBuilder` Java class. Such a feature allows greater readability and focus for the user as the terminal will not be cluttered with past commands.
`Ui` will call `ClearScreen.clearConsole()` method to clear the terminal.

The ProcessBuilder class will send a respective command to the terminal depending on the Operating System of the user.
The command it sends to the terminal is as follows:
* `cls` for Windows CMD Terminals
* `clear` for Linux/MacOS Terminals

`ClearConsole()` Code Snippet:

```
 public static void clearConsole() {
        try {
            // Get current operating system
            String operatingSystem = System.getProperty("os.name");

            if (operatingSystem.contains("Windows")) {
                // Try clear for Windows
                ProcessBuilder pb = new ProcessBuilder("cmd", "/c", "cls");
                Process startProcess = pb.inheritIO().start();
                startProcess.waitFor();
            } else {
                // Try clear for MacOS/Linux
                ProcessBuilder pb = new ProcessBuilder("clear");
                Process startProcess = pb.inheritIO().start();
                startProcess.waitFor();
            }
        } catch (Exception e) {
            System.out.println(e);
        }
    }
```

### Exceptions

The `FoodoramaException` class is responsible for handling errors such as unrecognised user commands and 
improper parameters. It does so by calling the `Ui` class to print error messages that prompt the User to 
type in correct Commands/Parameters

### Command Abstraction

![](images/command.png)

* Different Command Classes that perform different tasks by calling various functions of the Object Classes  
* All inherit from an abstract `Command` class with one execute method that takes an Arraylist<String> as input

## üìÇ Product Scope

Provides Developers with insights into our intended customers and the background to the problem to which
*Food-O-Rama* finds a solution.

### Target User Profile

Restaurant owners who will delegate their Inventory Management to Managers who are fast typists with experience in using
the Command Line Interface.

### Value Proposition

By presenting the wastage statistics, we can help restaurant owners figure out which dishes are contributing the most to
wastage at the restaurant. This way, they can allocate their resources more efficiently to better doing dishes. Thus we 
are reducing time wastage due to cooking of excess dishes and also saving money from purchasing unnecessary ingredients. 
Therefore, there‚Äôs a two-fold saving. Additionally, we are also contributing to reducing Singapore's contribution to 
global food wastage.
