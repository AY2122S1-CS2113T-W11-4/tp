### Ui Component

![](images/UiClass.png)

The `Ui` Class is responsible for the printing of interactive messages whenever a user types an input. It handles print messages to the Command Line Interface from when the program loads, to after every input by the user and finally when the user exits the program.

The interface of the program utilizes the ClearScreen class to clear the terminal after every user input through the built-in `ProcessBuilder` Java class. Such a feature allows greater readability and focus for the user as the terminal will not be cluttered with past commands.
`Ui` will call `ClearScreen.clearConsole()` method to clear the terminal.

The ProcessBuilder class will send a respective command to the terminal depending on the Operating System of the user.
The command it sends to the terminal is as follows:
* `cls` for Windows CMD Terminals
* `clear` for Linux/MacOS Terminals

`ClearConsole()` Code Snippet:
```
 public static void clearConsole() {
        try {
            // Get current operating system
            String operatingSystem = System.getProperty("os.name");

            if (operatingSystem.contains("Windows")) {
                // Try clear for Windows
                ProcessBuilder pb = new ProcessBuilder("cmd", "/c", "cls");
                Process startProcess = pb.inheritIO().start();
                startProcess.waitFor();
            } else {
                // Try clear for MacOS/Linux
                ProcessBuilder pb = new ProcessBuilder("clear");
                Process startProcess = pb.inheritIO().start();
                startProcess.waitFor();
            }
        } catch (Exception e) {
            System.out.println(e);
        }
    }
```
