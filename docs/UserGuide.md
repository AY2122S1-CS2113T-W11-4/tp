Food-O-Rama data can be written manually by editing the text files in *'Data'*. Refer to *Instructions for Manual
Testing* in the Developer Guide for the appropriate data format.

Dish
Format: `[DISH_NAME] | [AMOUNT_WASTED_IN_KG] | [WASTAGE_DIVIDED_BY_NUM_OF_LINKED_INGR] | [WASTAGE_LIMIT] | [INGR_1|INGR_2|etc.]`

* üí° *Note*: `[WASTAGE_LIMIT]` is `-1` when no limit is set.

Dish example of usage:

```
