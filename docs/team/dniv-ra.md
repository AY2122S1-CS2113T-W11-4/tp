## Project: Foodorama

Food-O-Rama is a food wastage tracking application for Restaurant Owners to keep track of food resources. It provides
users with insights on the amount of ingredients in storage and the amount of food wasted, be it in the form of dish
waste or ingredient waste. This allows Restaurants to better plan purchases of raw ingredients and enables more
efficient allocation of said ingredients to the cooking of dishes, ultimately saving cost and increasing profits.

### Summary of Contributions

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense Link](https://nus-cs2113-ay2122s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=Dniv-ra&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos&breakdown=true&checkedFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code~other&since=2021-09-25&tabOpen=true&tabType=authorship&tabAuthor=Dniv-ra&tabRepo=AY2122S1-CS2113T-W11-4%2Ftp%5Bmaster%5D&authorshipIsMergeGroup=false&authorshipFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code~other&authorshipIsBinaryFileTypeChecked=false)

* **Feature**: Added linking of dishes and ingredients
  * **What it does**: Allows the user to link an existing ingredient to an existing dish so that any wastage incurred
      on a particular dish reflects on the constituent ingredient as well
  * **Justification**: This feature improves the product as it helps the user consolidate all the wastages at one
    point to have a better understanding of where the losses stem from.
  
* **Feature**: Added limit feature for dishes and ingredients
  * **What it does**: Allows the user to set a limit for wastage of existing dishes/ingredients and prompts them when
       the wastage exceeds the limit set
  * **Justification**: This feature improves the product as the user does not have to actively look for the wastages
       and instead can focus on just providing the data for foodorama to work with.

* **Feature**: Added graphing feature for dishes and ingredients
  * **What it does**: Allows the user to view the wastages of dishes and ingredients in a graphical format
  * **Justification**: This feature improves the product as the user does not have to read through a long list of
      numbers wastages and instead can get a more visually appealing form of the data, helping the user get a better
      understanding of the data more intuitively. This also mitigates one of the disadvatages of cli with a basic form
      of graphical output.

* **Enhancement added**:
* **Contribution to other features**:
* **Contributions to UG**:
  * Added documentation for `limit` feature.
  * Added documentation for `graph` feature.

* **Contributions to DG**:
  * Added `Parser` component explanation.
  * Added `Storage` component explanation.
  * Drafted UML Diagrams for `General Flow` and `Command Abstraction`.

* **Contributions to team-based tasks**:
* **Review/mentoring contributions**:
* **Contributions beyond the project team**:
