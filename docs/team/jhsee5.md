## Project: Food-O-Rama
Food-O-Rama is a food wastage tracking application for 
Restaurant Owners to keep track of food resources. 
It provides users with insights on the amount of 
ingredients in storage and the amount of food wasted, 
be it in the form of dish waste or ingredient waste. 
This allows Restaurants to better plan purchases of raw ingredients 
and enables more efficient allocation of said ingredients to the cooking of dishes, 
ultimately saving cost and increasing profits.
